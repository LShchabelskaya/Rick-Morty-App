## Project description

This project demonstrates an example of pure Java Script code, working with DOM, API documentation, 
and using a fetch to get data from API https://rickandmortyapi.com/.

1. The app starts with rendering 10 cards of random characters from the famous cartoon show "Rick and Morty":

2. The app has two filters above to sort the characters received from API by such categories: gender (male / female) and status (alive / dead).
Both filters can work simultaneously.

3. While using filters the app generates 20 cards of characters every time when you press any filter button.
